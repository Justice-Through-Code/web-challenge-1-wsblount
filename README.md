# HTML Boilerplate

## Web Challenge 1

Your first HTML Challenge! 

After reading The Odin Project's Introduction to [HTML Boilerplate](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-html-boilerplate), follow along with the video in its **Assignment** section to create your own boilerplate HTML file!

### Estimated Time to Complete

30 minutes (includes reading time)

---

### Learning Objectives

Learn how to set up your main-page HTML template for every site you build

---

### Assignment Overview

Some things to think about:

- You're creating a homepage file from scratch. What does it need to be called?
- Your HTML tags and content will be checked against the expected final product from the video. Do they match?

## Summary

0. Accept the challenge via the GitHub Classroom link (if you're already here, you've done this part!)
1. Clone the repo to your computer
2. Follow the instructions in the video in the **Assignment** section of [HTML Boilerplate](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-html-boilerplate)
3. `git add`, `git commit`, `git push` your code

That's it-- this challenge (and following HTML/CSS challenges) will work a little differently than the others, as testing HTML/CSS works a little differently than testing Python code.
